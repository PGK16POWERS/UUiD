# Introduction
A UUID is a 128-bit unique identifier often used in software development to ensure the uniqueness of data across different systems. The uuid npm package allows you to easily generate these UUIDs in your JavaScript applications.

# Installation
To use the uuid package, you can install it using npm or yarn. Run one of the following commands: 
 **npm install uuid**

# Usage
In your JavaScript code, you should import the uuid package:
 **const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');**
 
This code imports the **'v4'** function, which is commonly used to generate random UUIDs.

To generate a **UUID**, you can use the **'uuidv4'** function:

**const myUUID = uuidv4();
console.log(myUUID);**

# Example
Here's a basic example of generating a UUID using the uuid package

**const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');**

**const myUUID = uuidv4();**
**console.log(myUUID);**
